Before we begin, let us discuss a few points.

## Why are we doing this workshop?

Programming is required for many physics projects. However, few of us learn how to program! This leads to lots of 'bad' code.

Often we judge code merely by whether it works. That is to say, code is good enough if it does what we want it to do and does it reasonably well. But this is a narrow definition that does not cover realistic issues we may face with code.

Some issues we face as scientists are the following.

- **Verification.** Just as we check others' paper-and-pencil calculations, so too should we check others' computer-based calculations. If we cannot understand the code, we cannot be sure it works as intended.
- **Reusability.** Often we want to build from others' work, including their code. If we cannot understand that code, we cannot use it correctly.
- **Extensibility.** Often we do not simply want to *use* the work of others but to build upon it. If we cannot understand others' code, we cannot modify it for our purposes.

Physicists have faced these issues as long as we have had computers. The common response to these issues is to *rewrite the code from scratch*. If you have to do this, it is a signal that you were dealing with bad code.

The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the process of creating good code.

### Why Python?

Python is rapidly becoming the scripting language of choice for performance agnostic scientific computing. It is easy to learn, widely used, and well-designed. 

Furthermore, many important and useful libraries are written in Python. Some examples include [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

## What to expect from this workshop.

We are not trying to teach you everything about Python or writing code. We are only trying to introduce you to the basics.

This workshop is *hands on* and *collaborative*. We want you to work together on exercises.

We expect a variety of skill levels from the attendees. If you know the material, *please help your neighbours*.

  
### Logistical comments:
    - You are welcome to use your own computer and/or your preferred software, but we cannot promise to be able to troubleshoot any issues you encounter. [Setup instructions here](tools/os_setup.md).
    - If you finish an exercise before others, please help others.
    - Ask sooner, not later.
