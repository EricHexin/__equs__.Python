# \_\_equs\_\_.Python workshop 2021
## Week 4 - Python modules and Git

Today we teach you how to properly package your Python code. For this, we collaboratively build a Python package. You learn how to document your code, spread it over multiple files, and how to write automated unit tests. To keep track of revision history, we create a repository on GitHub and show you how to use git and GitHub to develop and maintain code projects, especially when there are multiple contributors.


Here are the specific topics of the day:
