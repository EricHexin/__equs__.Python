# Linux

Virtually every distribution of Linux comes with a built-in text editor. If you're on ubuntu then this is likely to be `apt`, debian `dpkg`, red hat or fedora `yum`, arch `pacman` etc. Check your relevant man page.

# OSX - Brew
A package manager for the OSX operating system. This allows you to install software packages from your terminal. 
Installation instructions can be found (here)[https://brew.sh/].


# Windows - Chocolatey
A package manager for the Windows operating system. This allows you to install software packages from your terminal. 
Installation instructions can be found (here)[https://chocolatey.org/install]. You will need administrator privileges to do this installation, and as a result cannot install it to the lab machines.

# Windows - winget
Developed in house by Microsoft after extensively ripping off (AppGet)[https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/]. Apparently it works for now, but if Microsoft's other ventures in this direction are anything to go by then there's a reasonable chance it will end the same way as the "Windows Store". You may have to login to microsoft store for winget to install some packages.
